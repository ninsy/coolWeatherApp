#### TRICKY PARTS ###

#2015/12/05 
	During implementation of GeolocationPoints class using new ES2015 syntax,
	including new class and modules system, an obstacle has been met. At 5/12/2025,
	the modules system has not been yet implemented. Either transpilation from ES2015 to ES5, or
	enabling experimental mode in Chrome will have to be considered.
